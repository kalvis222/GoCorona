             <h1>Precaution</h1>
 			 <h2>To prevent the spread of COVID-19</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Clean your hands often. Use soap and water, or an
					alcohol-based hand rub.</li>
				<li>Maintain a safe distance from anyone who is coughing or
					sneezing.</li>
				<li>Wear a mask when physical distancing is not possible.</li>
				<li>Don't touch your eyes, nose or mouth.</li>
				<li>Cover your nose and mouth with your bent elbow or a tissue
					when you cough or sneeze.</li>
				<li>Stay home if you feel unwell.</li>
				<li>If you have a fever, cough and difficulty breathing, seek
					medical attention.</li>
				<li>Calling in advance allows your healthcare provider to
					quickly direct you to the right health facility. This protects you,
					and prevents the spread of viruses and other infections.</li>
				<div>

					<h2>Masks:</h2>
					<h3>Masks can help prevent the spread of the virus from the person
						wearing the mask to others. Masks alone do not protect against
						COVID-19, and should be combined with physical distancing and hand
						hygiene</h3>

					<img src="mask.jpg" style="width: 50%">

					<ul>
						<li>Clean your hands before you put your mask on, as well as
							before and after you take it off, and after you touch it at any
							time.</li>
						<li>Make sure it covers both your nose, mouth and chin.</li>
						<li>When you take off a mask, store it in a clean plastic
							bag, and every day either wash it if itâ€™s a fabric mask, or
							dispose of a medical mask in a trash bin.</li>
						<li>Do not use masks with valves.</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Sanitizer/Handwash: </h2>
					<img src="sani.jpg" style="width: 30%; padding-right: 9px;">
					<img src="handwash.jpg" style="width: 67%; ">
					<ul>
						<li>Regularly and thoroughly clean your hands with an
							alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. This
							eliminates germs including viruses that may be on your hands.</li>
						<li>Avoid touching your eyes, nose and mouth. Hands touch
							many surfaces and can pick up viruses. Once contaminated, hands
							can transfer the virus to your eyes, nose or mouth. From there,
							the virus can enter your body and infect you.</li>
						<li>Cover your mouth and nose with your bent elbow or tissue
							when you cough or sneeze. Then dispose of the used tissue
							immediately into a closed bin and wash your hands. By following
							good 'respiratory hygiene', you protect the people around you
							from viruses, which cause colds, flu and COVID-19.</li>
						<li>Clean and disinfect surfaces frequently especially those
							which are regularly touched, such as door handles, faucets and
							phone screens.</li>
					</ul>
